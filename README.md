```
pip install matplotlib
```

## Run Instructions

### From repository
- Open terminal (Ubuntu) and type the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Pruthvi-Sanghavi/AStar_RigidRobot.git
cd AStar_RigidRobot
python3 Astar_rigid.py
```
- In terminal enter the coordinates for 
- Start node as (50, 30, 60), clearance and robot radius as (0,0), step size as (1) and goal node coordinates as (150,150).

### From compressed folder
